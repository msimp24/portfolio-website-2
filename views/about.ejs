      <h3 class="about-h3">My Journey</h3>
      <p class="about-p">
        I’m a dedicated backend developer with a passion for building scalable,
        efficient systems and automating complex workflows. Before fully
        pursuing software development, I spent five years as a professional
        hockey player—two years in the American Hockey League and three years
        competing across Europe. Prior to turning pro, I played for the
        University of New Brunswick, where I earned two national championships
        and was a three-time Academic All-Canadian, maintaining a 3.5+ GPA while
        competing at a varsity level.
        <br /><br />
        My experience in professional sports taught me discipline, teamwork, and
        performing under pressure—skills I now apply to software engineering.
        Balancing travel, competition, and academic rigor strengthened my
        problem-solving abilities and resilience, which I bring to every project
        I tackle.
        <br /><br />
        With a Bachelor of Computer Science from UNB and hands-on experience
        building freelance projects, I have a full stack technical background
        with interest in specializing in backend systems, REST APIs, database
        design, and Python-based automation. I strive to write clean,
        maintainable code that scales, while continuously learning and improving
        my craft.
        <br /><br />
      </p>
      <h3 class="about-h3">What Drives Me</h3>
      <p class="about-p">
        I’m motivated by transforming complex requirements into elegant,
        functional solutions. Whether it’s architecting APIs, optimizing
        databases, or automating data pipelines, I approach each challenge with
        focus, attention to detail, and a commitment to quality. I'm eager to
        work with a team to build robust and production ready applications.
